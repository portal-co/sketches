Sketch 1:

tbh I had a similar idea, tho my sketch would go like this:
1. merges would be allowed, unlike most ledgers (and like Git), as long as merged blocks dont contradict each other
2. proof-of work would be required for all blocks, but they are mined by users on-the-fly
3. users would post their public key on the ledger to evade sybil attacks whilst keeping decentralization and avoiding currency
4. all that would go on the ledger would be zero-knowledge proofs, made in the VOLE-in-the-head scheme from [FAEST](https://faest.info/); user keys would, similarly, be FAEST keys
